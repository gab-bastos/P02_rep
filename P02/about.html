      <h2>About The Founder</h2>

      <p>
        After moving to Canada with his family, Gabriel fell in love with playing guitar at his High School music class.
        He bought his first used guitar in 2016, a black Squier Bullet Strat, the classic beginner guitar. That guitar
        inspired him to practice daily, leading to rapid improvement. After about a year or so, he bought his first
        semi-professional level guitar, a PRS SE Zach Meyers Signature, to be able to play at events and church
        services.
      </p>
      <p>Since then, Gabriel's expanded on his collection rapidly, with each guitar offering a different aspect
        to playing music, a different flavour. His belief, and part of his reason to start Strings and Things, is that
        although purchasing a guitar might not necessarily make you a better player, but it can certainly inspire you in
        a different way, pushing you to practice and improve your creativity as a musician.
